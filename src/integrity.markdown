What's this? {#about}
============

Integrity is the angel watching over your shoulder while you code. As soon
as you push your commits, it builds, runs your tests, and makes sure
everything runs fine.

It then reports the build status using [various notifiers][notifiers]
back to your team so everyone's on the same page, and if there's a problem,
you can get it fixed right away.

Read more about [Continuous Integration][ci] on Wikipedia.

Live demo {#demo}
=========

See how integrity works for yourself on [our own install][demo], watching
Integrity itself and the [various notifiers][notifiers].

Installation and deployment {#setup}
===========================

__It's ridiculously easy.__ All you need is to have `ruby` and `rubygems`
installed on your server, and then run the built-in installer.

    $ gem install integrity
    $ integrity install /home/www-data/integrity

This will create a couple files on your server,
mainly `config.yml` and `config.ru`.

The installer provides special configuration files for [Thin][]
and [Passenger][].

Passenger
---------

1. `integrity install --passenger ~www-data/integrity && cd ~www-data/integrity`
2. Tell Passenger to start your app: `touch tmp/restart.txt`

Thin
----

1. `gem install thin`
2. `integrity install --thin ~www-data/integrity && cd ~www-data/integrity`
3. Tweak `thin.yml` (generated by the installer) if necessary
4. Then, to start the Thin instance, just do this:

    $ thin -C thin.yml -R config.ru start

Configure a web proxy {#proxy}
---------------------

### nginx {#nginx}

    upstream builder-integrityapp-com {
      server 127.0.0.1:8910;
      server 127.0.0.1:8911;
    }

    server {
      server_name builder.integrityapp.com;
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://builder-integrityapp-com;
      }
    }

### Apache acting as reverse proxy to a cluster of thin instances {#apache-pxy}

    <VirtualHost *>
      <Proxy>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
      </Proxy>

      RedirectMatch ^/integrity$ /integrity/
      ProxyRequests Off
      ProxyPass /integrity/ http://localhost:8910/
      ProxyHTMLURLMap http://localhost:8910 /integrity

      <Location /integrity>
        ProxyPassReverse /
        SetOutputFilter proxy-html
        ProxyHTMLURLMap / /integrity/
        ProxyHTMLURLMap /integrity/ /integrity
      </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

If you run Integrity behind Apache + Thin, or Passenger, or other deployment
strategy, drop us a line at <info@integrityapp.com> and let us know what
config worked for you so we can include it here :-)

Configuration {#configure}
=============

Fortunately it's simple to configure. You only need to touch one file:

    /path/to/integrity/config.yml

Even better: the sample file generated by the installer explains all the
possible options. In case you want to see them anyway, you can see the
[source file on GitHub][configsrc].

Notifiers
=========

After a build is finished, you want to know the status __immediately__.
Integrity gives you a modular notification's system for this.

With Integrity, you can receive your notifications in a few different ways.
Don't worry, all of these are easy to set up:

- [Email](http://github.com/foca/integrity-email),
  by [Nicolás Sanguinetti][foca]
- [Jabber](http://github.com/ph/integrity-jabber),
  by [Pier-Hugues Pellerin](http://heykimo.com)
- [Campfire](http://github.com/defunkt/campfire),
  by [Chris Wanstrath](http://ozmm.org)
- [IRC](http://github.com/sr/integrity-irc), by [Simon Rozet][sr]
- [Twitter](http://github.com/cwsaylor/integrity-twitter),
  by [Chris Saylor](http://justhack.com)
- [Basecamp](http://github.com/pyrat/integrity-basecamp), by
  [Alastair Brunton](http://www.simplyexcited.co.uk)


Setting up your notifier {#setup-notifier}
------------------------

Also a piece of cake. For example, for email notifications:

    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    $ gem install foca-integrity-email

And then edit the `config.ru` file in your Integrity install directory:

    require "rubygems"
    require "integrity"

    require "notifier/email" # you need to add this line

And then restart Integrity. That's it. Now you can browse to
<http://integrity.example.org/my-project/edit> and configure your notifier.

More Notifiers
--------------

If you wrote a notifier for something else, let us know at
<info@integrityapp.com> and we'll add you here :)


Configure the Notifiers {#notifiers}
-----------------------

As explained on [the notifiers page][notifiers] all you need to do to get them
working after installing them is require them in the `config.ru` file generated
by the installer.

Once required there, you need to restart the app, and each notifier can be
configured on a per-project basis by browsing to the project and clicking on
the *edit* link

FAQ {#faq}
===

But does it work with *&lt;insert tech here&gt;*? {#other-tech}
-------------------------------------------------

Short answer: __Yeah!__

Slightly longer answer: as long as your build process can be run from an unix-y
environment __and__ it returns a *zero* status code for
success and _non-zero_ for failure, then integrity works for you.

How to use Integrity with a local repository? {#local}
---------------------------------------------

Set the project URI's to point to the `.git` directory of the
repository: `/home/sr/code/integrity/.git`

[git-sub]: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html

How do I use [git submodules][git-sub] with Integrity {#git-sub}
-----------------------------------------------------

Use this as your build command: `git submodules update --init && rake test`
It'll fetch and update the submodules everytime the project is build.
